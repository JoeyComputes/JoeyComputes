<h1 align="center">👋 Hello! I'm Saharat Joey Tosakoon</h1>

<div align="center" class="github-introduction">
  
I'm a **Computer Science Major** with a passion for coding, computers, and the internet. Growing up in the mid-2000s, I fell in love with computers as Windows XP was peaking, and that passion has driven me to break down consoles/parents' PC to see the layout to later learn about how to start Minecraft Servers.  Today, I am a college student studying Computer Science and mainly specialize in creating networking projects for myself. This could come with functionalities such as being able to access my **home lab** services from anywhere, handling **SQL** databases, and live hosting a **web server**.

Additionally, I'm currently diving into the world of Software Engineering, expanding my skill set to streamline the development processes and connect to others for projects in the future.
